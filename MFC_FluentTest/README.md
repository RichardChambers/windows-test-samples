MFC Fluent design techniques

This solution is to test out some techniques for providing Microsoft Fluent Design approaches to an MFC UI.

A synopis of the Fluent Design system as generated by Gemini AI in Google Chrome is:

Core Pillars (The 5 Blocks):
  - Light: Uses illumination to draw attention, create a sense of place, and highlight interactions (e.g., hover effects).
  - Depth: Employs layering, shadows, and perspective to create hierarchy and spatial awareness, moving beyond flat design.
  - Motion: Utilizes fluid, meaningful animations to guide users, convey information, and create seamless transitions.
  - Material: Simulates physical, tangible properties in digital, such as translucency, blur, and lighting, to create depth.
  - Scale: Ensures design elements adapt to various dimensions, from 2D screens to 3D, holographic, or mixed-reality environments. 


Key Design Principles:
  - Inclusive & Accessible: Designed to be accessible to everyone, catering to diverse abilities and demographics.
  - Intuitive & Familiar: Focuses on natural interaction, including voice, touch, and gaze, rather than just mouse/keyboard.
  - Focus-Driven: Helps users concentrate by reducing clutter and highlighting essential tasks.
  - Personalized & Connected: Aims to create a consistent, yet adaptable, visual language across different platforms and contexts.

Microsoft provides the WinUI toolkit, currently (as of 2026) WinUI 3 for Windows App developers using C# or C++.
There is an emphasis on using XAML or XAML islands with a COM based set of controls

See [Windows 11 design principles](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/design/design-principles) as
a starting point.

The goal of this prototype application is to investigate providing a Fluent Design approach using MFC as the implementation
language instead of XAML or using XAML islands.
