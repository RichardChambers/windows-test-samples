## Walk a Resource File listing contents

This is a simple Windows console application that parses a binary resource file and lists out the
contents.

This was an exercise as part of trying to understand resource files better. The application is
a bit rough and the solution file will create a compiled resource file.

This application is intended to be run in the debugger as part of seeing how to parse a resource file.
